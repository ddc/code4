Code4. Custom Iterator with Lazy Evaluation Implement a custom collection class that:
- Provides lazy evaluation of expensive transformations.
- Supports common operations like ltering, mapping, and reducing.
- Includes methods for pagination and chunking of results.
- Constraints:
  - Operations should be composable (chaining multiple transformations).
  - Memory usage should scale with output size, not input size.


## Usage
`python examples.py`


## Outputs
- All outputs will be logged inside a file in [logs](logs)
  - Using my [pythonLogs](https://github.com/ddc/pythonLogs) project as logger
- This is using the [examples.py](examples.py) file as testing
